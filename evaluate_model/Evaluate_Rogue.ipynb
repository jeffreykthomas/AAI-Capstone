It's important to remember that it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and exhausted as a new parent, and it's okay to ask for help. Here are some things you can try to help alleviate your feelings of sadness and anxiety:\\n\\n1. Reach out to your healthcare provider: It's important to let your healthcare provider know how you're feeling. They can help determine if what you're experiencing is related to postpartum depression or anxiety, and provide you with appropriate treatment options.\\n2. Practice self-care: Make sure you're taking care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally. This can include getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.\\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family members, or support groups for new parents. Talking to others who are going through similar experiences can help you feel less alone and provide you with a sense of community.\\n4. Set realistic expectations: It's important to remember that no one is a perfect parent, and it's okay to make mistakes. Try to set realistic expectations for yourself and your parenting, and focus on the things you're doing well.\\n5. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, can help you manage feelings of anxiety and stress.\\n6. Seek professional help: If your feelings of sadness and anxiety persist, consider seeking the help of a mental health professional.

      "Fine Tune Predictions: First of all, thank you for reaching out. There are a lot of people out there experiencing anxiety and PTSD and this can be really overwhelming. They are often fearful of going into counseling because of the possibility of not being able to handle it themselves and not feeling safe enough to tell their family or friends. You have probably already taken the first few steps towards being comfortable, which is why I recommend setting up some short-term goals for yourself that you can tackle on your own schedule. Next, there is a big difference between anxiety and PTSD, which is important to know. Anxiety is usually thought of as \"numbness\" when compared to actual symptoms. While there is some overlap (dysphoria, panic attacks) they are very distinct experiences. PTSD is a completely different experience and will require some work with therapists to help you get a clearer idea of what anxiety actually feels like. If you feel overwhelmed with worry about what might happen if you tell your family or friends, consider seeing a local mental health professional who can guide you through these anxiety symptoms. Finally, remember that there is nothing wrong with you. The most important thing is to get support from a trusted mental health professional if you ever have a moment where you need it. It's really important to connect with those you trust and put yourself at ease. As for your question about whether you're ready to go into counseling right away, it's not an easy decision, but I want to make sure that you know that you won't regret it. I hope that you and your husband/girlfriend are able to heal from this experience together and come out stronger from it. Best of luck to you and your husband/girlfriend!\n",

Whenever you feel like there’s a big change in the way you feel, it can be difficult to make changes in your life because you don’t know where it will go. That said, if there is something that is causing you distress, I would encourage you to try to talk with your primary care physician about your concerns and see if there is any physical reason for your symptoms. They can then look at medications and treatments that could help. Another option would be to seek out some support from friends or family members who have experienced similar challenges. I hope you get some good support, too.\n",

It is important to know that this is not something you have to go through on your own, but if it is something that you want to work on and talk to someone about, there are resources out there to help. You can find a local non-profit or support group that you can call. You may also be able to see a local therapist who specializes in working with children. If you have trouble finding an outside professional that you are comfortable speaking with, it would be a good idea to talk to a family member or a counselor. They may be able to provide you with guidance and advice. In addition, if you are unable to reach out to another trusted person in your life, there are many free resources available in your area that may be helpful.

You could always look at how to help your mom be a better parent by having more positive interactions with her or learning about other ways that she might support you in trying to work through your issues, but your mom seems to be very unwilling to listen to you and give you advice. If it was your mom's fault for whatever is happening in your life, then she should have seen that you are a very hard thing to be when you're under such extreme pressure and stress. But she doesn't want you to deal with problems you can't handle right now; instead, she's willing to throw you away if you're not going to do everything right in order to make your mom happy and get back on track. So, how do you handle your mom's complaints? Do you ask her questions about what's wrong with you? Do you ask her some of your worries as well? Are there things that she has noticed that would help you with your stressors? Is she willing to try something different than what she thinks will work for you? These are all ways of taking care of yourself and getting your needs met, rather than going over all the bad stuff with her. This could be done while you learn new skills, and it may also be helpful to have a therapist who is someone you trust and has some experience working with people who need emotional support.\n",

It’s not easy to let go of someone who is hurting you emotionally. There are ways that you can learn how to regulate yourself when you experience overwhelming emotions such as those described here. Some people find it helpful to journal about the thoughts and feelings they experience when they are having these intense emotions. This could be a great way to look at how your feelings are affecting you as well. You may notice that you are having these feelings even if you are asleep, but you can also think about them while you are lying in bed or in an anxious moment. You may try doing things that remind you that you are safe, such as checking your phone, or maybe taking a deep breath, just for example. If the thoughts and feelings persist, it may be important for you to talk with a friend or loved one about what you are experiencing. Having a support system of people you can share your thoughts and feelings with will help you feel better as well. Remember, we all have different levels of emotional awareness.

As you have already acknowledged, your feelings of wanting to please yourself by manipulating your partner is quite common in relationships. One of the most important parts of being loved is that we give ourselves love and that we allow others to offer it. It is essential to know that this dynamic doesn’t happen without your consent.

Your actions may be irritating or painful to you, however, it is important to recognize that the intention is not to harm you and you should not be able to change that. It is natural to want to help, and I am going to suggest you are very human. While it may feel like there are things to be done, it may be better to do them right before you fall in love with someone else.

We tend to think about how bad things may be, and it will seem much better if they are not. But when we focus on what is actually wrong with our lives, we create an unwanted stigma for ourselves that does nothing to help us get better.

It sounds like you have been dealing with a lot of negative feelings lately and this is completely normal. In order to address those feelings and find ways to feel more happy, and have a better future for yourself, it would be good to seek out a counselor or therapist. This can really help you work through these things so that you can start feeling better about yourself. There is a therapist that can help you with your challenges.

      "Fine Tune Predictions: What would you do if your family and friends were caught up in this secret?This is something that could cause serious problems for them. As a child, my mom and dad used to be very strict about what we did with each other, even in times when there wasn't much conflict. Even in those moments, when my mom would say something to me about me, she was always \"calmly,\" which made me believe that she thought I knew what I was doing. She also never had any real rules or ideas about what we were supposed to talk about at our family gatherings. That may have been one reason why my parents divorced so suddenly, and not long after.My guess is that this secrecy is partly a way for my parents to keep us in the closet, because they are afraid that telling the truth will damage their relationship with my mother, and potentially hurt her. They want my mother to fear that I am going to tell them what happened. The best way for my parents to try and keep us in the closet is for us both to lie. The problem is that people who do this are almost guaranteed to do harm. My father has lied many times, and he has used lies and black magic in order to get his way. If my mom lies, then she is just as likely to face severe consequences as my dad for lying. My guess is that they are trying to protect my mom from herself. I think my parents are worried that telling the truth will harm my mother too, because it is clear now that she is willing to lie in order to save herself. My guess is that they are afraid of their own power over me and my siblings, but I have little doubt that they are right. I want my parents to know that my silence is NOT okay. I know that it sounds like I'm saying that they should just give in and let me stay silent, but I really believe that that is not what they want. My parents need to know that if I want to make this about them instead of me, then I need to tell them the truth. I need to stop being afraid that they might find out what happened and go out of my way to tell them what happened. It doesn't matter what they do; if I can help them know the truth, then they don't have to keep me in the closet any longer.\n",

      "Fine Tune Predictions: I understand your situation. First, ask yourself why you are having this anxiety. This type of worry usually arises in situations that you cannot control. It could be a sudden medical emergency such as anaphylaxis, or an accident (in which there is no reason for your life to be in danger). The second reason might be more significant. If you have other family members that are not here, then consider asking them if they know what's happening and whether they would want their loved ones to be afraid around you. This may also be something you can share with them if you have had friends who have been through things like this and are still here. The third reason may just be because you have never had depression before. The last reason is really important if you ever experience such symptoms in the future. Depression can cause physical symptoms such as fatigue, sadness, and decreased motivation to do activities. Try talking to your doctor about seeing a counselor so that you can learn how to cope with depressive symptoms. They might be able to give you some relief without medication.\n",

      "Fine Tune Predictions: Hi there! There is no real way that this can possibly be normal, right? It would be completely inappropriate and childish for me to ever ask you that question. I'm sure that if you said something like that, people around you would probably have some type of reaction, but I just want you to know that my guess is that most people are not thinking in that way. You mentioned having \"friends\" for years, and while they may or may not be friends anymore, they still have an outlet for you to express yourself. This is something that is natural for adults, and I hope you find a supportive relationship with someone who will understand and accept that part of you. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that you may benefit from couples counseling (or perhaps individual therapy) where we are able to explore the similarities between us and what you're going through. In that case, maybe you could find other ways to connect with people? Like, perhaps one day you and your husband could go on dates, perhaps one day you and your son/daughter could play together, perhaps one day you and your daughter could join an activity group together. Just like any relationship, there will likely come a time when you need a little more connection and interaction. When we have these moments, however, they do provide us with some sort of release. When they don't, they tend to linger, and as they do, it becomes easier to push past them. We all know what happens when we push past these moments. We get stressed, we get depressed, we get anxious, and we end up feeling worse. These feelings are usually temporary, but once we begin to have these same moments again and again, we can start to feel stuck. Eventually, they become unbearable and we start to take them seriously. Sometimes when we don't have our moments of happiness and we let them define us, they can actually lead to self-hatred and depression. This is essentially a form of self-loathing. So, the idea here is to use couples counseling to work through some of those things, and eventually, you will have the freedom to enjoy and experience some happiness. What would that look like for you? Well, I have two guesses: one, if you are both healthy, happy, and in relationships, then maybe one person is \"their friend\" for\n",

      "Distilled Predictions: It sounds like you are having some difficulty connecting with those you care about in the way that you would feel in a relationship. I think that there may be some sort of fear or attachment issue at work here. When we have deep emotional connections with people, that means that we are drawn to them in a very uncomfortable way. This is especially true when we are very young and we may not realize how intense this feeling of being connected to someone can be. I wonder if you could tell yourself a few things: 1) Your relationship with these people is not meant to be that way. It’s not because they aren’t good or worthwhile people. It’s because you love them and they are special to you. You love them so much that you want them to be loved. And when you can find that you do, you will be more focused on how you are getting to know them instead of worrying about how you could “get to them” and “be with them” all at once. 2) The feelings you are feeling right now might be the result of a long-term, unresolved relationship. You may have a strong desire to connect with people but your desire is rooted in an unhealthy relationship. If you were a girl, maybe you would have been in a relationship where you were not connected to the people who made you happy. Maybe it was because you felt you were never “in love” with people and it wasn’t worth it to make a connection with them. The first step to healing is to find out if you actually do want to have a relationship with people and if that is the case, then you need to get to a place where you know for sure that you don’t need to be in relationships. You will be better off without them and perhaps that is a reason to look into it further. It would be a great idea to see a counselor about this because it may help you to understand why you might be in such a difficult situation and to learn ways of improving yourself and your relationship. But, you don't have to be stuck in a relationship to try and make sense of it.\n",

      "v2 Predictions: I think it is entirely possible that this is something that you have experienced at times, but not at all at other times. Sometimes we simply aren’t aware of how we feel about our friendships, and when we do feel some way in this space it may be difficult to truly fully believe that we’ve “gone away” from them. In addition to feeling sad or unsure of who you want to be with right now, if you were with someone who you were in love with and who is currently close to you, maybe you would still want to have the same relationship with them as you do with your best friend. Sometimes the way we view relationships can be very disconnected. If you feel that it would be helpful to talk to someone about this and get help from someone else in order to process these feelings, I highly recommend speaking with a therapist or counselor about it!\n"
